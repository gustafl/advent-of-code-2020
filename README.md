# Advent of Code 2020
This repo contains my solutions for the
[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) event. This was my first
year taking part, and it was very eye-opening to get exposed to things I didn't
even know I didn't know.

I chose to do the exercises in Python. I first learned Python in the mid 90's,
but only superficially. With Python becoming the go-to language for machine
learning, I have long wanted to return to Python and learn it properly. This
was my chance of doing so. In the end, I spent more time learning Python than
doing the exercises this year.
